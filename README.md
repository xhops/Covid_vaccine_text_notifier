# Covid_vaccine_text_notifier
Script to grab recent tweets from a Twitter covid vaccine tracker and send a text with a formatted list. Ideal to run as a cronjob or scheduled task on a server.

In this specific case, I wanted to create one for @IAVaccineAlerts as an example. They're doing great work trying to make the vaccine as accessible as they can for everyone.
